# Spring Boot Project Template

The purpose of this repository is to provide a template for quickly building proof of concept applications without
having to reimplement the wheel for each and every project.

The following setup has been implemented as part of the project:

* Spring Data with a connection to `Redis`.

## Redis Server Setup Docker Instance Installation

The `SpringBootTemplate` is built on an implementation of `Redis` using `Spring Data`. If you do not have access to
a `Redis`server, please follow the steps as below for getting started quickly.

This can be rapidly be setup by utilising `Docker` to setup the `Redis`container.

Below you will find `Docker`commands for downloading and starting up a local `Redis` instance.

```
> docker pull redis
> docker run --name=redis-devel --publish=6379:6379 --hostname=redis --restart=on-failure --detach redis:latest
```
